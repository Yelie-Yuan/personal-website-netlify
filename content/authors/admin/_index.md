Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD degree in Statistics at Department of Statistics, 
University of Connecticut. My interests lie in social network analysis,
network generation and rewiring.
As the department webmaster, I am working on websites 
including 
[the Department of Statistics at the University of Connecticut](https://stat.uconn.edu),
[the New England Statistical Society (NESS)](https://nestat.org/),
[the New England Journal of Statistics in Data Science (NEJSDS)](https://journal.nestat.org/).
<!-- [the Statistics in Pharmaceuticals (SIP2022) conference](https://events.stat.uconn.edu/SIP2022/),  -->

This website (under construction) includes my 
current research projects.
